# Face Recognition and Description Generation Project

This repository contains code for a project that combines face recognition and natural language generation for generating descriptions based on detected faces in images.

## Project Structure

- **file1_copy.ipynb**: Responsible for training the CNN model used to generate descriptions for detected faces, integrated into `llama2.py`.
  
- **EnvironmentDescriptor.ipynb**: Generates descriptions based on a prompt template.

- **llama.py**: Handles conversation and description generation. If a person is detected in the image, it prompts the user to identify them. Upon recognition, it appends "continue" and switches to `llama2.py`.

- **llama2.py**: Focuses on face labeling. It takes descriptions from the CNN model and integrates them with Gemini. If the user identifies the person, the module ends.

- **faceRecognition.py**: Generates face encodings for face matching in images to generate names for descriptions.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download `yolov4.weights` from [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights) and place it in your project directory.

3. Obtain your Google Gemini API key and store it in the environment file (`.env`).
